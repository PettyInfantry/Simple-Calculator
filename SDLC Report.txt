Full SDLC Explanation


 1. Requirements Phase
Goal: Define what the software should do.

Functional Requirements
- Accept two numeric inputs (`num1` and `num2`) from the user
- Accept an operation symbol (`operation`) from the set: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/.`
- Allow user to quit at any prompt by entering `q.`
- Perform the selected arithmetic operation using functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide.`
- Display result in format: `num1 operation num2 = result`
- Ask whether to continue (`y/n`) after each calculation
- Handle multiple calculations in one session (loop until user quits)

Non-Functional Requirements
- Console/terminal interface only
- Clear, readable prompts and output
- Graceful error messages (no stack traces shown to the user)
- Immediate exit on `q` input
- No external dependencies

Constraints
- Only basic arithmetic (no exponents, roots, memory, etc. in v1.0)

 2. Design Phase
High-level design
- Single-file script (`calculator.py`)
- One main control loop inside `main().`
- Four pure functions for calculations: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide.`
- All user interaction and flow control happens in `main(.)`
- Use `try-except` blocks to handle input errors

Low-level design (key decisions matching implementation)
- Inputs are read as strings → stripped → checked for `'q'` → converted to `float`
- `operation` is read as a string and compared exactly with `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, `'/.'`
- `divide(num1, num2)` explicitly checks `num2 == 0` and raises `ZeroDivisionError`
- Result is always printed with f-string formatting: `{num1} {operation} {num2} = {result}`
- Separator line (`---------`) improves readability between calculations
- Loop continues only if user enters `'y'` (case-insensitive)

Data types
- `num1`, `num2`: `float`
- `operation`: `str`
- All functions return `float` (or raise an exception)

3. Implementation Phase
The code has already been provided to you. Key implementation choices that match the design:

- Functions named exactly: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide.`
- Parameters consistently named `num1`, `num2`
- Main loop uses `while True` with `break` conditions
- `strip()` used on all inputs to remove accidental spaces
- `lower()` used for `'y'`, `'q'` checks → case-insensitive
- Descriptive welcome message and instructions about `q.`
- Clear separation of calculation logic from I/O

4. Testing Phase
Types of testing performed/recommended

- Manual/exploratory testing
  - Normal cases: 5 + 3, 10 * 4.5, 100 / 20 → correct results
  - Zero division: 50 / 0 → correct error message
  - Invalid number: “abc” → “Error: Please enter valid numbers!”
  - Invalid operation: “%” → “Invalid operation!” message
  - Quit at different points: `q` as first number, second number, or operation → exits cleanly

- Edge cases
  - Negative numbers: -8 * -2 → 16.0
  - Decimals: 1.5 + 2.7 → 4.2
  - Very large/small numbers (within float range)
  - Empty input (just Enter) → ValueError caught
  - Extra spaces: "  42  " → correctly parsed as 42.0

- Usability testing
  - Is the flow intuitive?
  - Are messages clear?
  - Does `q` work consistently?

(No automated unit tests in v1.0 — can be added later with `unit-test` or `pytest`)

 5. Deployment Phase
Deployment method: Single-file Python script

Steps for end-user
1. Have Python 3 installed
2. Download or clone `calculator.py.`
3. Open terminal → navigate to folder
4. Run: `python calculator.py` (or `python3 calculator.py` on some systems)

Distribution options
- GitHub repository (with the README)
- PyPI package (future – would need `setup.py`)
- One-file executable via PyInstaller (optional)

Environment: Any OS that runs Python 3 (Windows, macOS, Linux)

6. Maintenance Phase
Planned / possible activities

- Bug fixes
  - Improve handling of very long decimal results
  - Better handling of keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C)

Enhancements (possible future versions)
  - Add more operations: `%`, `*`, square root
  - Result history/memory
  - Command history (using `readline` or arrows)
  - Colored output (with `colorama`)
  - Unit tests
  - Configurable precision

 Versioning
  - Use semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0 → v1.1.0 for features)
  - Keep changelog in README or separate CHANGELOG.md

Monitoring
  - Watch GitHub issues/stars/forks
  - Respond to user feedback


Code Structure

Main components:
add(num1, num2) → returns sum
subtract(num1, num2) → returns difference
multiply(num1, num2) → returns product
divide(num1, num2) → returns quotient (raises error if divisor is zero)
main() → handles the entire user interaction loop
All arithmetic functions take two float parameters (num1, num2).

Error Handling
ValueError → caught when user enters non-numeric input
ZeroDivisionError → explicitly raised and caught in divide()
Generic Exception → fallback catch for unexpected issues
